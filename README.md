- Provides detailed results and evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srijansingh08/Intrusion_Detection_System_using_Machine_Learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd SVM.ipynb,
   cd Random_Forest.ipynb

## Usage

1.Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook SVM.ipynb and
jupyter notebook Random_Forest.ipynb

## Dataset

This project uses the NSL_KDD_CUP dataset for training and testing.

## Machine Learning Models

The notebook includes the implementation of Machine Learning models such as:
1.Support Vector Machines(SVM) and
2.Random Forest
